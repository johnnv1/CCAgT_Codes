<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to my public notes of my master's research</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:18px; margin-top:-14px; margin-bottom:-10px; font-weight: bold;">Public Repository to concentrate and document my codes</p> 
<p style="text-align: right; font-size:11px;">Written by João Amorim <br> Jul 30, 2020</p> 

This public repository will basically consist of codes and documentation that I developed during my master's degree. Obviously, only my finished and published researches or parallel things that do not impact the current stage of my research will be posted here.

A little about who writes to you, I am graduated in Computer Engineering at Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Sul - [UERGS](https://www.uergs.edu.br/inicial) (20/03/2015 - 20/12/2019) and currently (01/02/2020 - 01/03/2022) I am doing a Master in Computer Science (Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência da Computação - [PPGCC](ppgcc.posgrad.ufsc.br)) at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina - [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/). I have a research fellowship through Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação de Santa Catarina - [FAPESC](https://www.fapesc.sc.gov.br/). My line of research within PPGCC is Artificial Intelligence, where I work in the laboratory of Image Processing and Computer Graphics called [LAPiX](http://www.lapix.ufsc.br/) this laboratory is part of the National Institute for Digital Convergence - [INCoD](http://www.incod.ufsc.br/).

About my research and the content that will be found in this repository, the research is focused on using image processing algorithms and artificial intelligence to help diagnose malignant cells. The cells with which I work obtained through the technique of brush cytology, are cells of the cervix where to color is applied silver nitrate, this technique is known by the name Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organizer Region - AgNOR. To help in the diagnosis I must identify the nuclei, clusters, and satellites, after identifying the desire to characterize the cells. More information about the cells and images will be posted on specific pages of this repository.

Thank you for reading, I apologize for the mistakes in my writing in English and if there are suggestions or doubts feel welcome to contact me. And I hope the codes or explanations will give you some insights or help you with something.
